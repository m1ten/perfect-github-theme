## Packaging

Make sure you have NPM installed before beginning this process.

1. Clone the project - `git clone https://www.github.com/m1ten/perfect-github-theme`
2. Install `vsce` if you haven't already - `npm install -g vsce`
3. Package the extension - `vsce package`

You will now have a `.vsix` file in the root project directory that you can manually install into VS Code.
